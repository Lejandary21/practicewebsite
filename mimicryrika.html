    This innate technique is from Yuta Okkotsu, he has the ability to copy other techniques from other sorcerers, it's not confirmed yet if he's able to copy other inherited techniques like from the Gojo family. In order for the user to gain the copied ability, the user has to atleast get something from the user of the original technique. It can be a drop of blood or a piece of flesh as it was speculated. Rika is a Vengeful Cursed Spirit that has a mind of its own, yet still obeys the commands of her master. She's sort of a storage for cursed tools, cursed techniques and cursed energy. The confirmed abilities that Yuta has gained are Cursed Speech from the Inumaki family and Sky Manipulation from Uro. The only notable user is Yuta Okkotsu.
