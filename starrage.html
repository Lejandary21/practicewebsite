It has a long, serpent-esque body with sections that are covered with bone-like columns. This same material comprises Garuda's head, which is complete with two eyes and a bird-like bill. It also possesses eight wings that levitate around its body and enable flight. Garuda can also be affected with mass to itself, making it more physically powerful.</p>
