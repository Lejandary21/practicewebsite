      Ten Shadows Technique is an inherited technique from the Zenin clan like the Limitless and Six Eyes from the Gojo clan. This technique allows the user to summon up to 9 different types of Shikigamis (Shikigamis take form similar to cursed spirits but they conjure as familars with Jujutsu sorcerers to aid them), but the user has to start with the first type which are the Divine Dogs. The user must exorcise the other Shikigamis in order for them to be in the user's control. The user has to work together with the rest of the Shikigamis. The user can also manipulate the shadows to an extent, it can be used as storage or use them as travelling means. The notable users are Megumi Fushiguro, Ryomen Sukuna and an unknown Zenin clan member.
