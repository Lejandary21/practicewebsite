    <h1 class="blood">Blood Manipulation</h1>
      <p>Blood Manipulation is the priced technique of the Kamo family, one of the Big Three sorcerer families in the Jujutsu society. This technique is famous for its versality. The technique allows the user to control its own blood or other people's blood. The user can even manipulate the red blood cells, plasma and internal and external blood. External blood can either be used for attacks or even hardening the body. Another notable ability is that the user can control their temperature, blood flow and pulse, which enhances their energy and physical abilities. Blood Manipulation has a handful of external Techniques such as Flowing Red Scale (Increasing the user's body temperature, pulse rate and the number of red blood cells to increase its physical capabilities), Convergence (A technique that allows the user to harden and compress the blood to its limitation) and Piercing Blood (After using Convergence, the user is able to fire a long range beam of blood capable of piercing flesh. If enhanced with Cursed Energy, it can even reach the speed of sound) and etc. The notable users are Noritoshi Kamo and Choso.</p>
